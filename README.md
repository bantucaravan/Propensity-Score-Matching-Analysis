### Propensity Score Matching Analysis

This repository contains files in which I perform a series of exploratory simulations designed to compare the accuracy and suitability of propensity score matching with those of regression with conditioning on the confounding variables. I also write a propensity score matching function to get a better understanding of what is going on under the hood with this method.

Take a look at the pdf notebook of the work [**here**](/Propensity_score_Matching.pdf)
